-- "You should avoid having too many Stateful Components" -> So should I make the App Component the only stateful component, and the rest just get props? 
If I can have more than one Stateful prop, what's the logic behind designating one or the other as one?


QUESTIONS

> The 'Goal' and 'Next Steps' components are similar...
Should I nest the 'Goal' component inside the 'Next Steps' component?

> Item key and Id are the same...why not just target the key in the removeBooks? Similarly, why add an id at all?

> If we're not rendering firebase in App, the import line doesn't need to be included, right?


====

// 1) Create a method on app -- its function is to update the app state with the current firebase key for the goal
// 2) this methods needs to be passed down to goal, so that goal has access to it
// 3) from goal, we need to call update key via props and pass in the firebase key thart's generated during push of the goal
// 4) Pass this.state.key down to next steps and store that key in the button (data attribute)
// 5) on next steps button, use that key to push next steps to corresponding goal
